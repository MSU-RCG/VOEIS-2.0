These command files allow Yogo to be updated and run though Finder. 

The commands will checkout the yogo project into a yogo directory and attempt to setup the environment for yogo.

If the top directory of the current project is named yogo, they can be copied along side of it to start/stop/update/reset yogo.

The commands depend on having git 1.6 and ruby gems 1.3.6 in your path.
