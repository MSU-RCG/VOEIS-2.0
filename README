== Welcome to Yogo

Yogo is a Data Management System built on Ruby on Rails, DataMapper, and Persevere.

The build system should take care of this but...

== Getting Started with Development

1. Create a config/database.yml file (or rename the example one provided)
2. Install required gems: rake gems:install
3. Seed the database with initial data: rake db:seed 
4. Run the server by typing "glassfish"
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get the Yogo start page

== Setting up a Persevere Database

1. Get persevere and run an instance on port 8080
2. Optionally, run another instance on port 8181 for testing

The recommended way to do this is to download and install persevere to a standard application location.  Make sure that the persvr binary is available to the PATH. Go to the db/ directory of the app and run: 
persvr --gen-server yogo 
persvr --gen-server yogo_test 

Then cd into each one of those dirs and run: persvr -p PORT#

There should probably be a rake task to do this for you if the build environment doesn't.
