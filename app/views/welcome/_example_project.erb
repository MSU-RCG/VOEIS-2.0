The Example Project is organized with the following data model:

- The company is not represented, but has a set of warehouses to supply products to the customers.
- Each <em>Warehouse</em> has a set of <em>districts</em> it supplies items to. It also keeps track of the <em>Stock</em> of items it supplies.
- Each <em>District</em> has a set of <em>customers</em> it maintains relationships with.
- Each <em>Customer</em> orders items from the company, resulting in past and current orders.
- Each <em>Order</em> has a set of lines, one for each item ordered.
- Each <em>Order Line</em> corresponds to an item the company keeps in stock in the warehouse.
- Each <em>Stock</em> entry for a warehouse represents the quantity of each <em>item</em> the Company sells.
- Each <em>Item</em> is kept track of separately for the company, but defines what can be in stock in the warehouse.
