    <h2>Describe your data or upload spreadsheets</h2>

    <p>
      Before continuing we need to know about the data you would like to store.
      There are two ways to describe your data. Either by describing your data directly, or by uploading a CSV file.
    </p>

    <h3>Describe your Data Models</h3>
    
    <p>
      If you don't have any data yet, you can describe the data you anticipate on collecting.
      The description is flexible, and allows you to update the description at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre-loading your data with a spreadsheet.</h3>
    <p>
      If you already have your data in a spreadsheet, you can load in your data and dataset description all at once.  This is a convenient way to get started.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Requirements</h4>
    <p>1. The spreadsheets that can be loaded into the Yogo Data Management Toolkit must be in a particular format.  First, they must be in "comma separated values" format (often described as a "CSV" file).  Any modern spreadsheet application can export a spreadsheet in CSV format.</p>
    <p>2. The top three rows of the spreadsheet are special header information that the Yogo Data Management Toolkit needs to determine the character of the data columns.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first row contains the names of the variables (the column name)</li>
      <li>The second row contains the type of the values (text, number, etc.)</li>
      <li>The third row contains the units for the values (centimeters, degrees, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>For example, the contents of a spreadsheet might look something like the following image:</p>
    <%= image_tag('spreadsheet-example.png') %>
    
    <p>When the spreadsheet is exported as CSV, the resulting file would have following contents:</p>
    <pre>
   ID,      Name,    Mass,     Charge
   Integer, Text,    Decimal,  Decimal
   NA,      NA,      kg,       volts
   1,       Mickey,  1283.5,   1.2
   2,       Mario,   23492.2,  1.5
   3,       Sonic,   51213.8,  3.2
    </pre>
