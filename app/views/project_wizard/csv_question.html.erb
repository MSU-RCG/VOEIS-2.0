    <h2>Describe your data or upload spreadsheets</h2>
    <p>
      Before continuing we need to know about the data you would like to store.
      There are two ways to describe your data. Either by describing your data directly (from scratch), or by uploading a CSV spreadsheet file.

        <%= link_to('Design Data from Scratch', new_project_yogo_model_path(@project), :class => 'button-link center') %>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you don't have any data yet, you can describe the data you anticipate on collecting.
        The description is flexible, and allows you to update the description at any time.

      </div>
      <p>
        If you already have your data in a spreadsheet, you can load in your data and dataset description all at once.  This is a convenient way to get started.
