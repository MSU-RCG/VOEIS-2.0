# GroupDescriptions
#
# The GroupDescriptions table lists the descriptions for each of the groups of data values that
# have been formed.
# The following rules and best practices should be used in populating this table:
# * This table will only be populated if groups of data values have been created in the ODM
# database.
# * The GroupID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL.  It
# should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
# * The GroupDescription can be any text string that describes the group of observations.
