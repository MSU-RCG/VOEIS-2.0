# Sources
#
# The Sources table lists the original sources of the data, providing information sufficient to 
# retrieve and reconstruct the data value from the original data files if necessary. 
# The following rules and best practices should be followed when populating this table: 
# * The SourceID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL.  
# This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field. 
# * The Organization field should contain a text description of the agency or organization 
# that created the data. 
# * The SourceDescription field should contain a more detailed description of where the data 
# was actually obtained. 
# * A default value of “Unknown” may be used for the source contact information fields in 
# the event that this information is not known. 
# * Each source must be associated with a metadata record in the ISOMetadata table.  As 
# such, the MetadataID must reference a valid MetadataID from the ISOMetadata table.  
# The ISOMetatadata table should be populated with an appropriate record prior to adding 
# a source to the Sources table.  A default MetadataID of 0 can be used for a source with 
# unknown or uninitialized metadata. 
# * Use the Citation field to record the text that you would like others to use when they are 
# referencing your data.  Where available, journal citations are encouraged to promote the 
# correct crediting for use of data.
