# QualityControlLevels
# 
# This is a Data Qualifier
# The QualityControlLevels table contains the quality control levels that are used for versioning 
# data within the database.  
# This table is pre-populated with quality control levels 0 through 4 within the ODM.  The 
# following rules and best practices should be used when populating this table: 
# * The QualityControlLevelID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot 
# be NULL.  This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field. 
# * It is suggested that the pre-populated system of quality control level codes (i.e., 
# QualityControlLevelCodes 0 â€“ 4) be used.  If the pre-populated list is not sufficient, new 
# quality control levels can be defined.  A quality control level code of -9999 is suggested 
# for data whose quality control level is unknown.
