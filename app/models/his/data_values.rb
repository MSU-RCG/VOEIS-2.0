# DataValues
#
# This is a "Obersvations Values"
# The DataValues table contains the actual data values. 
# The following rules and best practices should be used in populating this table: 
# * ValueID is the primary key, is mandatory, and cannot be NULL.  This field should be 
# implemented as an autonumber/identity field.  When data values are added to this table, a 
# unique integer ValueID should be assigned to each data value by the database software 
# such that the primary key constraint is not violated. 
# * Each record in this table must be unique.  This is enforced by a unique constraint across 
# all of the fields in this table (excluding ValueID) so that duplicate records are avoided. 
# * The LocalDateTime, UTCOffset, and DateTimeUTC must all be populated.  Care must 
# be taken to ensure that the correct UTCOffset is used, especially in areas that observe 
# daylight saving time.  If LocalDateTime and DateTimeUTC are given, the UTCOffset 
# can be calculated as the difference between the two dates.  If LocalDateTime and 
# UTCOffset are given, DateTimeUTC can be calculated. 
# * SiteID must correspond to a valid SiteID from the Sites table.  When adding data for a 
# new site to the ODM, the Sites table should be populated prior to adding data values to 
# the DataValues table. 
# * VariableID must correspond to a valid VariableID from the Variables table.  When 
# adding data for a new variable to the ODM, the Variables table should be populated prior 
# to adding data values for the new variable to the DataValues table. 
# * OffsetValue and OffsetTypeID are optional because not all data values have an offset.  
# Where no offset is used, both of these fields should be set to NULL indicating that the 
# data values do not have an offset.  Where an OffsetValue is specified, an OffsetTypeID 
# must also be specified and it must refer to a valid OffsetTypeID in the OffsetTypes table.  
# The OffsetTypes table should be populated prior to adding data values with a particular 
# OffsetTypeID to the DataValues table. 
# * CensorCode is mandatory and cannot be NULL.  A default value of “nc” is used for this 
# field.  Only Terms from the CensorCodeCV table should be used to populate this field. 
# * The QualifierID field is optional because not all data values have qualifiers.  Where no 
# qualifier applies, this field should be set to NULL.  When a QualifierID is specified in 
# this field it must refer to a valid QualifierID in the Qualifiers table.  The Qualifiers table 
# should be populated prior to adding data values with a particular QualifierID to the 
# DataValues Table. 
# * MethodID must correspond to a valid MethodID from the Methods table and cannot be 
# NULL.  A default value of 0 is used in the case where no method is specified or the 
# method used to create the observation is unknown.  The Methods table should be 
# populated prior to adding data values with a particular MethodID to the DataValues table. 
# * SourceID must correspond to a valid SourceID from the Sources table and cannot be 
# NULL.  The Sources table should be populated prior to adding data values with a 
# particular SourceID to the DataValues table. 
# * SampleID is optional and should only be populated if the data value was generated from 
# a physical sample that was sent to a laboratory for analysis.  The SampleID must 
# correspond to a valid SampleID in the Samples table, and the Samples table should be 
# populated prior to adding data values with a particular SampleID to the DataValues table. 
# * DerivedFromID is optional and should only be populated if the data value was derived 
# from other data values that are also stored in the ODM database.   
# * QualityControlLevelID is mandatory, cannot be NULL, and must correspond to a valid 
# QualityControlLevelID in the QualityControlLevels table.  A default value of -9999 is 
# used for this field in the event that the QualityControlLevelID is unknown.  The 
# QualityControlLevels table should be populated prior to adding data values with a 
# particular QualityControlLevelID to the DataValues table.
