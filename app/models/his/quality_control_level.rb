# QualityControlLevels
#
# This is a Data Qualifier
# The QualityControlLevels table contains the quality control levels that are used for versioning
# data within the database.
# This table is pre-populated with quality control levels 0 through 4 within the ODM.  The
# following rules and best practices should be used when populating this table:
# * The QualityControlLevelID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot
# be NULL.  This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
# * It is suggested that the pre-populated system of quality control level codes (i.e.,
# QualityControlLevelCodes 0 â€“ 4) be used.  If the pre-populated list is not sufficient, new
# quality control levels can be defined.  A quality control level code of -9999 is suggested
# for data whose quality control level is unknown.
