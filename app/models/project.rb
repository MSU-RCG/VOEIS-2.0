  # Builds a "new", unsaved datamapper resource, that is explicitly
  # bound to the Project#managed_repository. 
  # If you want to create a new resource that will be saved inside the
  # repository of a Project, you should always use this method.
  # 
  # @example Create a new site that is stored in myProject.managed_repository
  #   managedSite = myProject.build_managed(Voeis::Site, :site_name => ...)
  #
  # @example Doing any of these will NOT work consistently (if at all)
  #   managedSite1 = Voeis::Site.new(:site_name => ...)
  #   managedSite1.save # WILL NOT save in myProject.managed_repository
  #
  #   managedSite2 = myProject.managed_repository{Voeis::Site.new(:site_name => ...)}
  #   managedSite2.save # WILL NOT save in myProject.managed_repository
  #
  # Boring Details:
  #   Initially "new" model resources do not bind themselves to any repository.
  #   At some point a "new" resource will persist itself and bind itself exclusively
  #   to the repository that it "persisted into". This step is fiddly to catch, and 
  #   happens deep inside the DataMapper code. It is MUCH easier to explictly bind
  #   the "new" resource to a particular repository immediately after calling #new.
  #   This requires using reflection to modify the internal state of the resource object,
  #   so it is best sealed inside a single method, rather than scattered throughout 
  #   the codebase.
