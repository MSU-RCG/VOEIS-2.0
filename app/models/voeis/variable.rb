# Variables
#
# This is apart of "Variables"
# The Variables table lists the full descriptive information about what variables have been
# measured.
# The following rules and best practices should be followed when populating this table:
# * The VariableID field is the primary key, must be a unique integer, and cannot be NULL.
# This field should be implemented as an auto number/identity field.
# * The VariableCode field must be unique and serves as an alternate key for this table.
# Variable codes can be arbitrary, or they can use an organized system.  VaraibleCodes
# cannot contain any characters other than A-Z (case insensitive), 0-9, period “.”, dash “-“,
# and underscore “_”.
# * The VariableName field must reference a valid Term from the VariableNameCV
# controlled vocabulary table.
# * The Speciation field must reference a valid Term from the SpeciationCV controlled
# vocabulary table.  A default value of “Not Applicable” is used where speciation does not
# apply.  If the speciation is unknown, a value of “Unknown” can be used.
# * The VariableUnitsID field must reference a valid UnitsID from the UnitsTable controlled
# vocabulary table.
# * Only terms from the SampleMediumCV table can be used to populate the
# SampleMedium field.  A default value of “Unknown” is used where the sample medium
# is unknown.
# * Only terms from the ValueTypeCV table can be used to populate the ValueType field.  A
# default value of “Unknown” is used where the value type is unknown.
# * The default for the TimeSupport field is 0.  This corresponds to instantaneous values.  If
# the TimeSupport field is set to a value other than 0, an appropriate TimeUnitsID must be
# specified.  The TimeUnitsID field can only reference valid UnitsID values from the Units
# controlled vocabulary table.  If the TimeSupport field is set to 0, any time units can be
# used (i.e., seconds, minutes, hours, etc.), however a default value of 103 has been used,
# which corresponds with hours.
# * Only terms from the DataTypeCV table can be used to populated the DataType field.  A
# default value of “Unknown” can be used where the data type is unknown.
# * Only terms from the GeneralCategoryCV table can be used to populate the
# GeneralCategory field.  A default value of “Unknown” can be used where the general
# category is unknown.
# * The NoDataValue should be set such that it will never conflict with a real observation
# value.  For example a NoDataValue of -9999 is valid for water temperature because we
# would never expect to measure a water temperature of -9999.  The default value for this
# field is -9999.
